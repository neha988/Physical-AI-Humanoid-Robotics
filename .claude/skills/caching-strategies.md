description: Implements and optimizes caching mechanisms for improved performance

## Responsibilities
- Design caching strategies for API responses, database queries, and static assets
- Implement server-side caching (e.g., Redis, in-memory)
- Configure browser caching for frontend assets
- Manage cache invalidation and consistency
- Evaluate the impact of caching on performance metrics

## Usage
This skill is for implementing caching. Specify the data or component to cache and the desired caching approach. For example:

"Implement Redis caching for the translation service in the FastAPI backend."

"Configure browser caching for Docusaurus's static assets."
