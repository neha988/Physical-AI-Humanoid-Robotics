description: Designs and implements Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipelines for data ingestion
---

## Responsibilities
- Design and build data extraction modules from various sources (e.g., Markdown files, databases)
- Implement data transformation logic, including cleaning, enrichment, and chunking
- Develop data loading mechanisms to target systems (e.g., Qdrant vector database)
- Automate pipeline execution and scheduling
- Ensure data quality and validate pipeline outputs

## Usage
This skill is for building data pipelines. Describe the source, transformations, and target system. For example:

"Create an ETL pipeline to ingest Docusaurus markdown content into Qdrant."

"Develop a transformation step to chunk text content by markdown headers."
