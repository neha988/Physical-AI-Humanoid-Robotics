## Responsibilities
- Define data validation rules and schema checks
- Implement validation steps within ETL pipelines
- Monitor data quality metrics and report anomalies
- Design error handling and data recovery strategies
- Ensure data consistency across different systems

## Usage

"Add data validation to the chunking process to ensure all chunks have required metadata."

"Implement schema validation for the data before uploading it to Qdrant."
