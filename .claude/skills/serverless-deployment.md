description: Deploys applications to serverless platforms like Vercel or AWS Lambda
---

## Responsibilities
- Configure serverless deployments for frontend (e.g., Docusaurus to Vercel) or backend (FastAPI to Vercel/Lambda)
- Manage environment variables and secrets in serverless environments
- Set up custom domains and HTTPS
- Optimize serverless functions for cold start times and resource usage
- Monitor and troubleshoot serverless deployments

## Usage
This skill is for deploying to serverless platforms. Specify the application and the target platform. For example:

"Deploy the Docusaurus frontend to Vercel."

"Configure the FastAPI backend for deployment as a Vercel serverless function."
