description: Implements lazy loading for frontend components and images to reduce initial page load
---

## Responsibilities
- Configure lazy loading for React components using dynamic imports
- Implement image lazy loading with `loading="lazy"` or intersection observers
- Optimize routing for code splitting by route
- Evaluate the impact of lazy loading on Core Web Vitals
- Ensure a smooth user experience with loading indicators

## Usage
This skill is for improving frontend load performance. Identify the components or assets that should be lazy-loaded. For example:

"Implement lazy loading for the chat widget component in the Docusaurus frontend."

"Configure lazy loading for all images in the documentation pages."
