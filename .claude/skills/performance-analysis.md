name: performance-analysis
description: Diagnoses performance bottlenecks and identifies optimization opportunities
---

## Responsibilities
- Analyze frontend load times, rendering performance, and responsiveness
- Profile backend API endpoints for latency and throughput
- Identify inefficient database queries and N+1 problems
- Evaluate resource utilization (CPU, memory, network)
- Use tools like Lighthouse, Chrome DevTools, and profiling libraries

## Usage
This skill is for diagnosing performance issues. Describe the problem and the area of the application to investigate. For example:

"Analyze the page load performance of the Docusaurus homepage."

"Profile the `/api/chat` endpoint to identify latency bottlenecks."
