description: Simulates attacks to find security vulnerabilities
---

## Responsibilities
- Conduct simulated attacks (e.g., injection, XSS, broken access control)
- Test for misconfigurations and weak security controls
- Identify exploitable vulnerabilities and their impact
- Document findings and provide detailed exploit steps
- Suggest patches and hardening measures

## Usage
This skill is for active security testing. Provide specific targets (URLs, API endpoints) and types of attacks to simulate. For example:

"Perform a basic SQL injection test on the `/api/users` endpoint with parameter `id`."

"Check for XSS vulnerabilities on the search input field of the Docusaurus frontend."
