## Responsibilities

- Determine semantic relationships between text segments
- Generate summaries or extract keywords from chunks
- Classify content based on predefined taxonomies
- Perform sentiment analysis (if relevant to user feedback)

## Usage
This skill helps in understanding the content's meaning. Provide text or a chunk and ask for specific semantic insights. For example:

"Identify key technical terms in the following paragraph about robot kinematics."

"Summarize the main points of this section for use as chunk metadata."
