description: Creates, modifies, and integrates React components within the Docusaurus frontend
---

## Responsibilities
- Develop new React components for interactive UI elements
- Modify existing React components to add features or fix bugs
- Integrate components into MDX pages or Docusaurus themes
- Ensure components follow React best practices and Docusaurus guidelines
- Write unit tests for new or modified components

## Usage
This skill is used for all React-related development tasks. Provide clear instructions for component name, location, props, and desired functionality. For example:

"Create a new React component `src/components/ChatWidget.js` that displays a chatbot interface."

"Modify `src/theme/Navbar/index.js` to add a new button that toggles dark mode."
