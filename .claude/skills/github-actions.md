description: Configures and manages CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions
---

## Responsibilities
- Create new GitHub Actions workflows (`.github/workflows/*.yml`)
- Modify existing workflows for build, test, and deployment
- Configure secrets and environment variables for actions
- Set up event triggers (push, pull_request, schedule)
- Debug workflow failures and optimize execution time

## Usage
This skill is for all CI/CD tasks using GitHub Actions. Describe the desired workflow and its triggers. For example:

"Create a GitHub Action to deploy the Docusaurus frontend to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`."

"Add a step to the backend deployment workflow to run tests before deploying to Vercel."
