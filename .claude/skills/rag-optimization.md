description: Optimizes Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system performance and accuracy
---

## Responsibilities
- Fine-tune chunking strategies for better retrieval
- Evaluate and improve embedding models for specific domains
- Implement re-ranking algorithms for search results
- Optimize query expansion and reformulation techniques
- Monitor RAG system performance and identify bottlenecks

## Usage
This skill is for improving the effectiveness of the RAG system. Describe the current RAG issue or the desired improvement. For example:

"Suggest improvements to the current chunking strategy to enhance retrieval accuracy for code examples."

"Evaluate the effectiveness of different embedding models for our robotics textbook content."
